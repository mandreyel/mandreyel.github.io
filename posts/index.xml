      <description>Disclaimer This is a heavily work-in-progress draft. Some details may not be correct.
Starting points There are currently four ways in which a URL may be loaded: - the first time the browser is opened (when a new top-level browsing context is created); - when the user clicks on a link or a script navigates the page (both are handled by the script thread); - when the user types a URL (this is handled by the compositor); - and finally the WebDriver can also initiate URL loads.</description>

      <description>Motivation I recently started contributing to Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s Servo, a new browser engine experiment, eventually intended to be merged into Firefox.
I take a lot of notes as I walk through the code base (it&amp;rsquo;s quite vast&amp;ndash;at the time of writing the Rust portions alone are 1.5M CLOC), and I thought I&amp;rsquo;d put them online, primarily for myself as future reference, but also in hopes that it may be useful for others starting out.</description>
